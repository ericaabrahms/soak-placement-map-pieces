TODO:

Make a single piece:
- draw rectangle
- create vertical rectangle with text
    - rotate rectangle
- create a rectangle with a gradient background with text
    - rectangle background is gradient
- add an image (e.g. coffee, tea, sound)
- add a circle with a number in the middle
- determine where to place top left corner of circle, rectangle, text (that's not hard coded)
- loop through geography, interactivity, to place in border of rectangle

CSV management:
- import CSV
- loop through each line (map headings to values?) e.g. {sound_zone: "SZ 1"}
- create map piece
- save map piece

- process one line?
- process ALL lines

Nice to have:
? handle font sizing
? set header, footer height based on size on plot size
