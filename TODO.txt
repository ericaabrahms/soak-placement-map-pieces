TODO:

Make a single piece:
x draw rectangle
x create vertical rectangle with text
    x rotate rectangle
- create a rectangle with a gradient background with text
    - rectangle background is gradient
x add an image (e.g. coffee, tea, sound)
x add a circle with a number in the middle
- determine where to place top left corner of circle, rectangle, text (that's not hard coded)
x loop through geography, interactivity, to place in border of rectangle
x Make red text for hard SZ preference ('Make SZ work? Data' == 'We would prefer not to be placed.')
x Handle camp name bg color based on interactivity time
    yellow = text.contains('morning')
    red = text.contains('afternoon')  || text.contains('evening')
    blue = text.contains('night')
    green = text.contains('support)
- Add neighborhood preference (split sz bar in 2?)

CSV management:
x import CSV
x loop through each line (map headings to values?) e.g. {sound_zone: "SZ 1"}
- create map piece
x save map piece

- process one line?
- process ALL lines

Nice to have:
? handle font sizing
x set header, footer height based on size on plot size


Readability:
- improve resolution
- scale for large camps and small camps
